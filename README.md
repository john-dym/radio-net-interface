# Radio Net Interface
To connect a UHF radio/walkie-talkie to a server so that clients can communicate remotely.

Idea is to connect a walkie-talkie to usb audio device which is connected to a Raspberry Pi Zero that has internet access. Clients will connect using their phones, so that they can listen with in and speak on the RF network.
